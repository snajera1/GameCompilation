## Quick 'n' Fun Games ##
Group name: Quick Connections
Group member: Samuel Najera


This is a compilation of three quick and fun games, Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Hangman. The main goal of this project is to provide a quick and easy way to spend time with yourself or with a friend when you don't have much time but want to still enjoy some games by yourself or with someone else. Hopefully it can be used to deepen some connections between friends too! 


To launch the program from the command line, make sure you are in the same folder as the jar file and run this command:

java --module-path (your_javafx_file_path)/lib --add-modules javafx.base,javafx.controls,javafx.graphics,javafx.media,javafx.swing -jar QuicknFunGames.jar


To play a game, just click the button labeled with the game you'd like and check the radio button for the mode you would like to engage! "1 player" pits you against the computer and "2 player" lets you play against a friend. For Hangman, "Normal" is what it sounds like, but "Hard" makes you guess the words backwards! For a more detailed explanation on how to use the app, check out the user manual.
